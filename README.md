# _Cifar100
Repo consists code to classify 100 classes from one of the tensorflow inbuilt dataset


◾ This is the dataset found in tensorflow

◾ With 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 for testting 


◾ The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a subclass

◾ and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs)

◾ Have used One hot encoding on Image pre-proccessing 
  
◾ CNN model is used with main layers BatchNormalization, Flatten, Dropout 

◾ Generated classification_report to know the accuracy for each class
